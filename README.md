## Git tidbits
To manouvre between folders in the terminal, use "cd ../" followed by the name of the folder.


To push a file in git, there's two steps: staging, and committing.

Staging happens when you use "git add" to choose which changes you want to commit.

Committing happens afterward, where you commit the changes along with a message.


To skip staging, you can write "git commit -am """ in your commit prompt.
